# Micro Academic Library

## Application start up:
- launch [download_pdfs.py](scripts%2Fdownload_pdfs.py)
- launch [import_to_db.py](scripts%2Fimport_to_db.py)
- launch [app.py](app.py)
- open http://127.0.0.1:5000

## Further improvements:
- add downloading PDFs by using tags (it is better to use existing package, e.g. PyPaperBot)
- add script to interact with OpenAI API (it requires paid subscription)
